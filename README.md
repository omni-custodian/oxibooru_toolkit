Oxibooru toolkit works with Szurubooru, Oxibooru, and any other booru using the Szurubooru Json Rest API

This project is currently in alpha and any contributions are appreciated.

The toolkit will create a default config.toml in the directory that you use the command in that you will need to set with the correct variables.

Current commands:
szurubooru_rust_toolkit upload post [folder]
